# juniordevframework Community Contributing Guide 1.0

## Vocabulary

* A **Maintainer** has repo level access.
* A **Core Contributor** is any individual merging code into the project during its alpha build.
* A **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request.

## Logging Issues

Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt, log an issue, and
any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the responses. The only
exception is security disclosures which should be sent privately.

Contributors may direct you to another repository, ask for additional clarifications, and
add appropriate metadata before the issue is addressed.

Please be courteous and respectful. Every participant is expected to follow the
project's Code of Conduct.

## Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes
to documentation, code, binary files, etc. 

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that
contributors in other timezones have time to review. Consideration should also be given to
weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active contributors all have reasonable time to
become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no contributor has an objection.
During a review, contributors may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a
particular area gives a "LGTM" before the PR can be merged. There is no additional "sign off"
process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by contributors are addressed it can
be landed by any contributor.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another contributor, all involved
contributors should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed
by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.

## Becoming a Contributor

Just create an issue or pull request!
